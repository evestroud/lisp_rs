# lisp_rs

An exploratory learning project! I'm building a simple Lisp interpreter (aiming for something Scheme-like) in Rust. Doesn't do much yet currently, but I want to get a basic "S-expression calculator" up and running then expand it into a more fully-functional Lisp by adding features like list processing, control flow, lambdas, definitions, etc.!

To run: clone repo and `cargo run` in the directory. Probably helps to have cargo and rust installed!
